Let me tell y'all 'bout this one time at Walmart (Listen)
Walked in and played it so smooth, I grabbed the shopping cart (Smooth)
Break my cousin off a couple hundred 'cause she play her part (Here)
I scammed the same Walmart fifty times, I gotta play it smart (Fifty times)

Listen to what I gotta say, I'm bout to get honest (Just listen)
Play it crazy like I'm shopping here for clothes, then hit electronics (I play it crazy)
Grab some Xboxs and TVs, I think about seven
I told 'em that these all gifts so they won't even question (They not mine)
Soon as I got up to the counter, they start asking questions
Like am I getting these for kids or some family members (I'm nervous)
I said 'cause I ain't get 'em nothin' for Christmas in December (I responded)
She responded back like, "Okay, sir, I understand" (Okay)
Had an Xbox in the left, a TV in the other hand (Handful)
Told her, "I think I lost my cash, let me call my friend" (Oh shit)
I let two minutes pass by, then reached inside my pocket
Now this when shit 'bout to get real and nobody can stop it (Okay, listen)
Pulled out the debit card that I just embossed
Was hoping that the clerk ain't look at it weird or have to call the boss (Please don't look)
She ask me what I like to do, I said playin' golf (What you like to do?)
I stuttered when she asked that question, I had to play it off (I-I-I don't know)
She said my total was twenty-five hundred plus tax (Twenty-five hundred)
Thinkin' to myself, soon as I'm done, I'm getting X Maxes (For real)
She bagged everything up and put 'em in the cart (Thank you)
My shit approved, I no longer got a racing heart
Even though it went through, I still gotta play it smart (I still gotta play it smart)
'Cause I was here for gift cards from the very start
Now I'm 'bout to go to Aisle 7 where my cousin at
She let me slide at any time and I'm lovin' that (Good lookin')
She let me push through five thousand and I double back (Appreciate it)
So you can add it up yourself how much I made in here (Just add it up)
Got all the items that I needed, then I disappear (I'm gone)
Rental was filled up with Xboxes and TVs
Was hot as hell on our way to AT&T
Plus I had my Bluetooth MSR on the backseat (Backseat)
Too hot to take the freeway, we took the backstreet (C'mon)
I'm lucky we ain't get caught on our way to the phones (Thank God)
Walk in smooth, I gotta go through these same steps
But before I walk in, I gotta take a breath
Walk up to the counter, "Can I apply for iPhone X?" (C'mon)
All my profiles got good credit so I be payin' less
Four hundred dollar down payment but I ain't even stressed (Four hundred)
I love a profile with seven hundred credit score
'Cause I can grab four iPhones, then grab some more
If I was doin' it online, it'd be way quicker
Punch however much the fees, get next day shipping
They catch me somewhere where my plug next day flippin'
Off of this nigga alone, I made six figures
I get a thousand every jack, he in Mount Clemens
